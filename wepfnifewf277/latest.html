  <h2 id="newh">Manufacturing issues cause turmoil of “GreenBell Inc”</h2>

  <p class="newp">
  GreenBell Inc., formerly dominating the home appliance market prior to 2018, has struggled to keep up their performance as compared to past years. What has caused such a trend? Are they taking any actions to remedy the situation? Most importantly, how much longer do they have before they start losing significant market share? These are questions most stakeholders in the company desperately want answers to.
</p>

  <p class="newp">
  Before understanding their financial struggles, one must understand their manufacturing woes. One of GreenBell Inc.’s major manufacturing plants in Decatur, Alabama has had a lower output this year when compared to the previous. Upon identification of the issue, it was detected that the company malfunctioned production of some of their appliances which led to unhappy customers. When asked for a statement, GreenBell Inc.’s CEO stood strong and stated “we will continue being a leader in quality home appliances and bring our customers’ trust back by exceeding their expectations. A minor setback will not affect the foundation of this company which is built on being an environment-friendly, customer success driven organization”.
</p>

  <p class="newp">
    GreenBell Inc. is still a leading firm in the home appliance industry and seems like a company that can dig themselves out of this situation. Multiple sources have reported that they’re actively looking for consultants to assist them in finding a possible solution. At the end of the day, in order to stay on top of the competition, they need to recover fast and come back stronger. When and how this can happen is still up for debate, but one thing that is certain is that time is on their side, as many investors still believe that the company is “too big to fail”.
